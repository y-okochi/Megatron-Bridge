"""Type definitions for forward step function definitions.

This module provides comprehensive type definitions for forward step functions used in
Megatron Bridge training. Forward step functions are the core of the training loop,
responsible for performing a single forward pass and returning both the output tensor
and a loss function.

Key Types:
    - ForwardStepCallable: Union of all supported forward step signatures (functions + functors)
    - LossFunction: The partial function returned by forward step functions
    - LossFunctionReturn: The possible return types when calling a loss function

Example Usage:
    >>> from functools import partial
    >>>
    >>> def my_forward_step(state: GlobalState, data_iterator, model, return_schedule_plan=False):
    ...     # Get batch data
    ...     batch = next(data_iterator)
    ...
    ...     # Forward pass
    ...     output_tensor = model(batch['input_ids'])
    ...
    ...     # Create loss function
    ...     def loss_func(output_tensor):
    ...         loss = compute_loss(output_tensor, batch['labels'])
    ...         num_tokens = batch['labels'].numel()
    ...         loss_reduced = {"lm_loss": loss.detach()}
    ...         return loss, num_tokens, loss_reduced  # ThreeTupleLossReturn
    ...
    ...     return output_tensor, partial(loss_func)
    ...
    >>> # Use with pretrain
    >>> pretrain(config, my_forward_step)

    This protocol represents classes that implement __call__ with one of the

    forward step logic that benefits from object-oriented design.

    - 2 args: (data_iterator, model)
