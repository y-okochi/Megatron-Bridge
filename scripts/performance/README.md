# Performance Recipes

## NOTE: This directory will change a lot over the coming weeks.


- Scripts defined in `scripts/performance` are recipes optimized for performance. These scripts can launch pre-training experiments on Slurm based clusters.

## YAML configuration files

There are YAML configuration files for supported models in `scripts/performance/llm/configs`.
- You can override the defaul configs using these files. 
- Follow key-value conventions as present in `megatron.bridge.training.config.ConfigContainer`
- You can override any config as present in base classes in Megatron-LM.

## Example

The following line shows an example of how you can launch a pre-training experiment-

`python -m scripts.performance.llm.pretrain_llama3_8b --account <your_slurm_account> --partition <your_slurm_partition> --gpu gb200`

## Configuration Options

- Slurm account, partition and gpu are mandatory arguments for launching the experiment.
- You can use the following optional arguments as needed-

- You can use the following optional arguments as needed-
  - -l/--log_dir: Location to store your experiment artifacts and logs.
    - Make sure the environemnt variable `NEMORUN_HOME=<log_dir>` is accessible and set correctly in your virtual environment.
    - You can run `export NEMORUN_HOME=<log_dir>` in your terminal. You can add it your bashrc file (or equivalent for your OS/Linux distro) for setting it permanently.
  - -t/--time_limit: Maximum time limit for your experiment. Your slurm job will be cancelled after this. Default is 30 minutes.
  - -i/--container_image: The NeMo container you want to use. Defaults to latest dev container- 'nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:dev'.
  - -c/--compute_dtype: Specifies whether you want to use bf16 or fp8 precision for training. Defaults to 'bf16'. You can choose to use 'fp8'.
  - --fp8_recipe: FP8 recipe. Options: 'ds' (per-tensor delayed scaling), 'cs '(per-tensor current scaling), 'mxfp8' (block-level scaling -- 32 values). Defaults to 'ds'.
  - -en/--enable_nsys: Enable nsys profiling. It is disabled by default. When enabled, profiling will be enabled for 1 step from step 5 to step 6. You can change the step in the respective recipe script.
  - -d/--dryrun: Using this argument will not launch the experiment. It will simply print the sbatch script to stdout. This can be helpful to verify you have set your experiment correctly as needed.
  - -g/--gpu: Target gpu type. Defaults to 'h100'. Options- 'h100', 'b200', 'gb200'.
  - -ng/--num_gpus: Number of gpus.
  - -gn/--gpus_per_node: Number of gpus per node. Defaults to 8.
  - -cm/--custom_mounts: Comma separated string of mounts.

## Virtual Environment

- For creating a virtual env on login node on a Slurm cluster, comment the following lines in `pyproject.toml` present in parent directory of this repo-

```
"megatron-core[dev,mlm]>=0.14.0a0,<0.16.0",
```

```
no-build-isolation-package = [
    "transformer-engine",
    "transformer-engine-torch",
    "mamba-ssm",
    "causal-conv1d",
    "nv-grouped-gemm",
    "flash_mla",
]
```

- From the parent directory of this repo, run the following 3 commands-

```
git checkout malay/perf_scripts
python -m venv bridge_venv
source bridge_venv/bin/activate
pip install .
pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Run.git
```

- GOOD NEWS: You DO NOT need have version parity (for configs in YAML files) for NeMo/Run and Megatron-LM between the venv and NeMo container image. 
  - The YAML config files are resolved on compute node inside the container. Feel free to use any Megatron-LM configs present in the container version regardless of the version in your venv
